## 5 Systematic Complexity Reduction of Interfaces
The base interfaces specified in VDI/VDE/NAMUR 2658-3 [5] are defined for a wide range of use cases in the process industry - from laboratory to the fabrication. These interfaces are too comprehensive for many use cases in the discrete industries like logistics or manufacturing. Therefore, this section will intro-duce some blueprints to reduce the complexity of those interfaces.

This section will be extended in a future version of this document.
